# AngularTodoListTutorial

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.0.5.

This is following the tutorial from https://ng-girls.gitbook.io/todo-list-tutorial/ in late June 2021.

## Tutorial notes
- `ng g c input-button-unit` is the same as `ng generate component input-button-unit`.
- `input [value]` is one-way binding, while `input [(ngModel)]` can be one or two-way binding. The latter also adds a lot more functionality.
- Element event binding = parens and dropping the `on`.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
